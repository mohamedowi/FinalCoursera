# FinalCoursera
This is the final Assignment of coursera, i decided to put it in a new repository to have a clean start. I have implemented the move,copy,set,zero,reverse,reserve and free in the memory.c and memory.h . I have also done atoi and itoa in the data.c and data.h. In addition, I made if def verbose on print array in every file where it's called, also course1() compile time in main function. I also adjusted the source.mk file to match new folder and files Inserted.
